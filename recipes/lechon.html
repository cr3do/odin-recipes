    <h1>Lechon</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Lechon, derived from a Spanish word for roasted suckling pig is one of the most popular dishes in the Philippines. 
        The slowly-roasted suckling pig is usually stuffed with lemongrass, tamarind, garlic, onions, and chives, 
        and is then roasted on a large bamboo spit over an open fire.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>1 Whole Pig (Live weight of about 18-20 kilos)</li>
        <li>Patis (Soy Sauce)</li>
        <li>Salt and Black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 Liter of Sprite for the glaze</li>
        <li>For stuffing the pig:
            <ul>
                <li>10 bundles of Tanglad (Lemongrass)</li>
                <li>8 pieces of bay leaves</li>
                <li>2 kilos of green onion leaves</li>
                <li>5 cups of Garlic; crushed</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons of cooking or olive oil.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Cooking instructions</h2>

    <h3>Prepare the Pig</h3>
    
    <p>
        In preparing the pig, make sure that its spit is durable and its structure can withstand the weight of the pig you will be roasting. 
        Roasting the pig involved rotating it the entire cooking time. Having a stable and durable spit can prevent the pig to fall off from its spit.
    </p>

    <h3>Season and Stuff the pig</h3>

    <p>
        First, rub the insides of the pig with salt and pepper. Also rub it on the body outside together with olive oil or cooking oil. 
        Then, stuffed the insides with crushed garlic, onion and bay leaves. Bay leaves are used for the distinctive fragrance it give to the dish. 
        Next, after cleaning and slightly smashing the Tanglad (lemongrass), stack it into the center of the stomach of the pig. 
        Slightly smashing Tanglad releases a lemony aroma added to the Lechon Baboy. Finally, stitch the cut. 
        At home, I use cotton thread and the largest needle I can find. A needle should be sharp enough to poke through the skin easily. 
        Stitching it up helps prevent the stuffing from falling off while rotating the lechon during the cooking process.
    </p>

    <h3>Roast</h3>

    <p>
        To get the fire started, I would like to start it by using wook at first and eventually loading it with charcoal. 
        Make sure to prepare a lot of charcoal so that you will not run out. When the charcoal is hot enough, put the pig over it and gradually rotate it. 
        I usually start the distance of the pig from the charcoal at about 500 mm high and make some adjustments later on.
    </p>

    <p>
        To prevent the pig from burning and to allow its skin to be extra crispy and golden red in color, paint the whole pig with sprite from time to time.
    </p>

    <p>
        We usually rotate the roasting pig manually. We either put a stand on each end to place the bamboo pole. 
        Manually rotating it can take a lot of patience and time, make sure you also have someone readily available to switch with you in rotating the roasting lechon baboy.
    </p>

    <p>
        If after 4 hours have passed since the roasting process started, or depending on the size of the pig, the Lechon Baboy is now cooked. 
        An easy way to know if Lechon Baboy is already cooked is by looking on its outside, the skin should be golden brown and crispy. 
        You can also check the temperature by putting a thermometer into a thicker part of the pig. You should get at least 140 degrees 
        fahrenheit and that should be it. Your Lechon Baboy is now ready to be served.
    </p>

    <p>
        In other countries, they usually served Lechon Baboy by cutting the head and cutting the whole lechon into pieces. 
        But in the Philippines, we rather serve it as a whole and allow guests to get a portion by themselves using a knife and a pork. 
        This will make eating Lechon Baboy more enjoyable.
