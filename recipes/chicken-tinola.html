    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Chicken Tinola is a Filipino soup dish. It involves cooking chicken pieces in ginger broth. 
        It is a popular cold weather dish. I always feel warm and cozy every time I eat it. 
        This Filipino Chicken Soup is best enjoyed with fish sauce as dipping sauce, and a cup of warm white rice.
